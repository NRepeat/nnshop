## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 12 added: SEO Technical Bugs — fix repetitive path 404s, search page noindex, tags outside head
- Phase 13 added: SEO Redirect Architecture — simplify redirect chains to single 301, fix language routing
- Phase 14 added: SEO Meta Data Templates — fix short/long/duplicate titles and missing meta descriptions
- Phase 15 added: SEO Schema Markup — add OnlineStore, WebSite, SearchAction, ItemList, shipping/return schemas
- Phase 16 added: SEO Image Alt Text — add descriptive alt text to all product and content images
- Phase 17 added: Gender Navigation Architecture — derive gender from URL instead of cookie to fix back navigation state bug
- Phase 18 added: SEO audit fixes (canonical, redirects, 404s, image optimization, meta-tags)
- Phase 19 added: Search refactor — FSD structure + quick fixes (popup discount/layout, mobile header, single GraphQL source)

### Decisions

- [Phase 16]: Standardized product alt text format as `{Product Title} {Variant Info}` to balance SEO and readability.
- [Phase 17]: Eliminated 'gender' cookie and moved to URL-derived state via segments and x-gender header.
- [Phase 17]: Removed dead components GenderProvider and SetGenderCookie that relied on cookie state.
- [Phase 17]: Refactored all header/navigation components to use headers() for gender state, ensuring consistency during back-navigation.
- [Phase 17]: Updated ProductView to use headers() and URL-based collection handles for breadcrumbs, maintaining context without cookies.
- [Phase 19-search-refactor-fsd-structure-quick-fixes]: ProductCardSPP wraps internally with Link; SearchResultsGrid uses outer div + onClick to avoid nested anchors while still closing popup
- [Phase 19-search-refactor-fsd-structure-quick-fixes]: /search page now passes locale to predictiveSearch; RU users on /ru/search get RU-localized results (popup parity)
- [Phase 19-search-refactor-fsd-structure-quick-fixes]: Unified grid breakpoints: grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 (page's denser set adopted as default)
- [Phase 20]: /search uses two-call filter-defs pattern from getCollection.ts; skip when only q/sort/limit present
- [Phase 20]: Search results page reuses collection FilterSheet/SortSelect/ActiveFiltersCarousel/ClientGrid/LoadMore without forking; LoadMore handle prop receives query string
- [Phase 20]: SearchSortKeys lacks CREATED; created-desc silently degrades to RELEVANCE rather than forking SortSelect
